### Mini-projects List

A list of miniature projects to help me practice python. Because, we've all gotta have goals. 

* ~~**ISS tracker**~~  --  Uses APIs to pull data down about the ISS's current crew, location, and when it'll pass over. This is now done! See https://github.com/jakeherold/python/tree/master/miniprojects/issFinder

* ~~**D&D Dice Roller**~~ (Done - with room to improve)  --  Simple rolling tool with which dice type to roll, and how many of them. Should take inputs of the "dX" number (d6, d10, d12, etc) and dice count. Will output individual rolls, as well as the sum total. To be expanded upon or utilized in some kind of D&D DM tool (because in for a nerd penny, in for a nerd pound, right?).

* **Hangman**  --  Should have a decent visual depiction in ASCII art (because I've never done that and wanna try). Try to find a dictionary API and randomize the word that needs to be guessed.  **Stretch Goal:** include easy, medium, hard mode based on word length. **Stretch Goal:** include easy, medium, hard mode based on number of vowels.

* **Database**  --  Read, write, update a table. SQLite seems like a good starting place and I mainly gotta get some DB Practice. 

* **Project Euler**  --  Start working through [Euler's code exercises](https://projecteuler.net/ "That Project Euler Good-loud")

* **Web Crawler**  --  Scrape some stuff with Python

* **TwitterBot**  --  Post a status && respond to a retweet automatically

* **MSU Python Projects Archive**  --  http://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse231/PracticeOfComputingUsingPython/

* **CodingBat**  --  http://codingbat.com/python

* **Stand up any Web Server with Python**   --  Hello world and then iterate

* **Codewars**      --  See what this is about. Seems kinda neat.
